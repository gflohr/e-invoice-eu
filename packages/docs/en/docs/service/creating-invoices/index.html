The [% q.lanchor(name='general-mode-of-operation') %] is to first [map]([% q.llink(name='mapping') %])
spreadsheet data to the [internal invoice format]([% q.llink(name='internal-format') %]) in JSON and then generate an
e-invoice XML or a hybrid PDF/XML file from that JSON. But it is also
possible to bypass the first mapping step and generate the invoice directly
from JSON data.

<qgoda-toc />

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must have:

* A spreadsheet template. The examples assume that you use the template in `contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods`.
* A [mapping definition]([% q.llink(name='mapping') %]). The examples assume that you use the mapping file in `contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml`.
* [LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org/) installed on your system (not always necessary).
* You have [started the server]([% q.llink(name='deployment') %]). The examples assume that the server is available at http://localhost:3000.
* You have changed directory to the top-level directory of the repository so that the sample files are available.
* You have set the necessary [environment variables]([% q.llink(name='deployment') %]#environment-variables).

E-Invoice-EU uses [LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org/) in headless mode to
create PDFs from spreadsheet files. If you do not use this feature, there is no
need for LibreOffice. Alternatively, you can always provide a PDF file from
other sources instead of generating it from spreadsheet data.

## Creating Invoices from Spreadsheet Data

The API endpoint for this functionality is
`/api/invoice/transform-and-create/:FORMAT`.

### Basic E-invoice

In its most simple form, you can create an e-invoice from the spreadsheet data
like this:


[% FILTER $CodeGroup %]

[curl]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/UBL \
    -F data=@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    -F mapping=@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml
[% END %]

[httpie]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
http --form POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/UBL \
    data@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    mapping@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml
[% END %]

[% END %]


The format is a path parameter that is specified after the endpoint path
`api/invoice/transform-and-create`, in this case `UBL`. The format is
case-insensitive.

The invoice data (parameter `data`) is read from the spreadsheet file
`contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods`. That spreadsheet data is then
[mapped]([% q.llink(name='mapping') %]) (parameter `mapping`) with the mapping definition
`contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml`.

### E-Invoice with Additional Attachments

It is possible to attach files with additional information.  This works
both for pure XML formats and for hybrid Factur-X/ZUGFeRD e-invoices.  The
example creates a Factur-X Extended invoice with two attachments:


[% FILTER $CodeGroup %]

[curl]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
curl -X POST \
    http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/UBL \
    -F lang=de \
    -F data=@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    -F mapping=@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml \
    -F embedPDF=1 \
    -F pdf=@invoice.pdf \
    -F pdfID=1234567890 \
    -F pdfDescription="Invoice as PDF." \
    -F "attachment=@time-sheet.ods;type=application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet" \
        -F "attachmentID=abc-123-xyz" \
    -F attachmentDescription="Detailed description of hours spent." \
    -F attachment=@payment-terms.pdf \
    -F attachmentDescription="Our payment terms"
[% END %]

[httpie]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
http --form POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/UBL \
    lang=de \
    data@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    mapping@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml \
    embedPDF=1 \
    pdf@invoice.pdf \
    pdfID=1234567890 \
    pdfDescription="Invoice as PDF." \
    attachment@time-sheet.ods\;type=application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet \
    attachmentID=abc-123-xyz \
    attachmentDescription="Detailed description of hours spent." \
    attachment@payment-terms.pdf \
    attachmentDescription="Our payment terms"
[% END %]

[% END %]


Let us break that down into the individual URL parameters sent:

* `lang`: This is used to determine the language for some canned texts.
* `data`: The spreadsheet with the invoice data.
* `mapping`: The [mapping definition]([% q.llink(name='mapping') %]) for the invoice data.
* `embedPDF`: Embed a PDF version of the e-invoice in the XML; ignored for Factur-X/ZUGFeRD.
* `pdf`: The PDF version of the e-invoice. If embedding a PDF was requested but the parameter `pdf` is missing, the PDF is generated from the spreadsheet file (parameter `data`).
* `pdfID`: The attachment id of the embedded PDF, defaults to the filename.
* `pdfDescription`: An optional description of that attachment.
* `attachment`: Optionally, an additional file to be embedded.
* `attachmentID`: Optionally, the id of the attachment, defaults to the filename.
* `attachmentDescription`: An optional description of the attachment.

[% title = "Generate PDF From Spreadsheet Data" %]

[% WRAPPER components/infobox.html type='warning' title=title %]

If the PDF is not provided with the parameter <code>pdf</code>, it is generated from
the spreadsheet file (parameter <code>data</code>).  In that case you must
ensure that the LibreOffice executable is found. It must be either in your
<code>$PATH</code> or you have <a
href="[% q.llink(name='deployment') %]#libre_office-code">configured its
location</a>.

[% END %]


Each attachment to the e-invoice may have an optional id and an optional
description. However, the service only "sees" 3 lists of the URL parameters
`attachment`, `attachmentID`, and `attachmentDescription`, even if you
group them per attachment.

If you use the parameter `attachment` four times, `attachmentID` twice,
and `attachmentDescription` three times, in whatever order, the following
attachments are embedded:

| Attachment        | Filename        | ID | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|----|-------------|
| **Attachment #1** | `attachment` #1 | `attachmentID #1` | `attachmentDescription #1` |
| **Attachment #2** | `attachment` #2 | `attachmentID #2` | `attachmentDescription #2` |
| **Attachment #3** | `attachment` #3 | - | `attachmentDescription #3` |
| **Attachment #4** | `attachment` #4 | - | - |

You will probably want to avoid that hassle by specifying an id and/or
description either for all attachments or for none.

## Factur-X/ZUGFeRD Example

There is nothing special about creating Factur-X/ZUGFeRD, only that the output
is binary and you want to redirect it to a file.


[% FILTER $CodeGroup %]

[curl]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/Factur-X-Extended \
    -F data=@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    -F mapping=@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml >e-invoice.pdf
[% END %]

[httpie]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
http --form POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/transform-and-create/Factur-X-Extended \
    data@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    mapping@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml >e-invoice.pdf
[% END %]

[% END %]


This would create a Factur-X/ZUGFeRD e-invoice with the profile
*Extended*.

You must also keep in mind that the hybrid Factur-X/ZUGFeRD format *requires*
a PDF version of the input. You must either specify it yourself with the
parameter `pdf` or `LibreOffice` must be available so that it can be generated
from the spreadsheet file `data`.

## Creating Invoices from JSON

You can bypass the [mapping step]([% q.llink(name='mapping') %]) and generate the invoice directly from
JSON.  The endpoint for that is `/api/invoice/create/:FORMAT`.

Example:


[% FILTER $CodeGroup %]

[curl]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/create/UBL \
    -F invoice=@contrib/data/default-invoice.json
[% END %]

[httpie]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
http --form POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice/create/UBL \
    invoice@contrib/data/default-invoice.json
[% END %]

[% END %]


In this case, a Peppol UBL invoice is created.

This endpoint allows the exact same URL parameters as the [endpoint for
creating invoices from spreadsheet
data](#e-invoice-with-additional-attachments) except for the parameter
`mapping` which makes no sense.

## Create JSON Data from Spreadsheet Data

You can also create invoice data in the [internal format]([% q.llink(name='internal-format') %]) from a spreadsheet
file with the endpoint `/api/mapping/transform/:format`. This is probably
only useful for informational purposes because JSON is not an allowed format
for e-invoices.

Example:


[% FILTER $CodeGroup %]

[curl]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mapping/transform/UBL \
    -F data=@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    -F mapping=@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml
[% END %]

[httpie]
[% FILTER $Highlight "language-sh" %]
http --form POST http://localhost:3000/api/mapping/transform/UBL \
    data@contrib/templates/default-invoice.ods \
    mapping@contrib/mappings/default-invoice.yaml
[% END %]

[% END %]


This endpoint only supports two URL parameters:

* `data`: The spreadsheet with the invoice data.
* `mapping`: The [mapping definition]([% q.llink(name='mapping') %]) for the invoice data.

[% title = "Why is the Format Needed?" %]

[% WRAPPER components/infobox.html type='info' title=title %]

This endpoint [maps]([% q.llink(name='mapping') %]) data from a spreadsheet file into the [internal format]([% q.llink(name='internal-format') %]) which
is supposed to be independent of the output format. Still, you have to supply
the format because the transformation also inserts the default customization id
in the field `/ubl:Invoice/cbc:customizationID`. If the customization ID is
supplied in the spreadsheet data, you can pass an arbitrary format because
an explicitly specified customization ID is never overwritten.
