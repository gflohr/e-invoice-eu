# @e-invoice-eu/server

This directory contains the source code of the E-Invoice-EU web service
with a RESTful API. The service is written with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/).

## Pre-requisites

- NodeJS 17 or newer (currently tested with NodeJS 18, 20, and 22)
- A package manager like npm, yarn, pnpm, bun ...

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

This may warn about "husky" missing. Just run `pnpm install` again in order
to fix this.

If you do not like `pnpm`, replace it with `npm`, `yarn`, `bun` or whatever
is currently hyped.

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```

## Running in a Container

By far the easiest way is to run the application in a software container.

Pull the Docker image:

```sh
$ docker pull gflohr/e-invoice-eu:latest
```

Run the container:

```sh
$ docker run -it --rm -d -p 3000:3000 --name e-invoice-eu gflohr/e-invoice-eu:latest
```

If you want to debug issues, omit the option `-d` so that you can see the
output of the application running inside of the container.

Access the application from your host computer:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/format/list
```

Or you can see the [OpenAPI/Swagger documentation](https://www.openapis.org/):

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api
```

It probably makes more sense to open that URL in the browser.

See the [documentation](http://localhost:3000/e-invoice-eu/e-invoice-eu/en/docs/service/creating-invoices/)
for information on how to create e-invoices with the API.
